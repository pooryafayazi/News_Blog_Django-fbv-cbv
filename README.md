# News-Blog-Django (RestAPI)
This repository features a Django news blog demonstrating both function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs). Users can create, read, update, and delete articles, with a focus on clean code and best practices. The project adheres to RESTful API principles, including the use of appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), meaningful URL structures, and proper HTTP status codes for responses. It includes user authentication using JWT for API account management and integrates CI/CD for streamlined deployments. Additionally, it utilizes Celery with Redis for sending emails, ensuring a responsive design for access to the latest news on any device.
